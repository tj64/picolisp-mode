UNIT can be:

• 'glyphs — sequence of visible glyphs. Useful for file name, URL, …, that doesn't have spaces in it.
• 'line — delimited by “\\n”.
• 'block — delimited by “\\n\\n” or beginning/end of buffer.
• 'buffer — whole buffer. (respects `narrow-to-region')
• a vector [beginRegex endRegex] — The elements are regex strings used to determine the beginning/end of boundary chars. They are passed to `skip-chars-backward' and `skip-chars-forward'. For example, if you want paren as delimiter, use [\"^(\" \"^)\"]

• 'line always returns the line without end of line character, avoiding inconsistency when the line is at end of buffer.
• 'word does not depend on syntax table.
• 'block does not depend on syntax table."
